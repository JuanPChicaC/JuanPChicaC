<h3 font-weight =  bold> About the project </h3>
<span>
  This project offers as a result a web service that gives portfolio distribution suggestions based on the investment interests of the client (Investors or third party 
  apps). The <b><i>Portfolio Delivery Service</i></b> has two main objectives, the first one is to show to developers that suggestions systems are not just only based into 
  <b><i>Machine Learning</i></b> models, in this case is sufficient just to solve an optimization problem to give an advise about portfolio management. On the other hand, the 
  project pretend to give an example about how a theorical model could be bringed into production to offer real solutions for people, the <b><i>Modern Portfolio Theory</i>
  </b> (created by Harry Markowitz in 1952) was the concept that is encapsulated to give answer about the investment advise askings. The solution is aimed at minmize the risk 
  per expected return of client portfolios.

<span>
  This list of repositories contain all the required scripts to replicate the project, the list will be presented in order to maintain the suggested track of development, but 
  each repository works independent from others in case that just one specific functionality want to be taken.
